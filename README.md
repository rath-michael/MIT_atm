# MIT ATM Refactoring Assignment

This assignment asked me to take the ATM we went over in the demo classes and refactor it myself.
I wanted to spend more time learning how to work with the components so I spent a majority of my time taking the basic concept of the assignment and basically rewriting the entire application from the ground up, instead of using the provided code from the instructors.

As of writing this, 5/14/2023, the application isn't complete and still requires work, but it is technically in a working state right now.
